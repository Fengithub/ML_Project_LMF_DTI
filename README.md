# Logistic Matrix Factorization for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction on STITCH database

project done by Fen Pei and Chi Zhang


In this project, we performed DTI prediction based on STITCH version 4 human subset, employing 
Logistic Matrix Factorization (LMF) machine learning methods, and compared it with baseline
method Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF). Results demonstrated that LMF out performed PMF by 48% in terms of mean squared error.
The DTI prediction model helped guide further development of DTI prediction method on even larger database, and the prediction results could
be used for drug-repurposing, drug combinations and disease mechanism inferring studies.
